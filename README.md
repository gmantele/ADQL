# ADQL

## What is it?

ADQL: **A**stronomical **D**ata **Q**uery **L**anguage

ADQL is the language used by the [IVOA](http://www.ivoa.net/) to represent
astronomical queries posted to VO services (e.g.
[TAP](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/)). It is based on the Structured Query
Language (SQL), especially on [SQL-92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92).
The VO has a number of tabular data sets and many of them are stored in
relational databases, making SQL a convenient access means. Thus, a subset of
the SQL grammar has been extended to support queries that are specific to
astronomy.

## Status?

The last stable version is
**[REC-2.0](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html)**.

Next version will be 2.1. A
[Proposed Recommendation](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/20180112/) is
already available. _It is not yet finalized and so, should not be considered
yet as stable for operational implementation._
