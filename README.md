# ADQL

## What is it?

ADQL: **A**stronomical **D**ata **Q**uery **L**anguage

ADQL is the language used by the [IVOA](http://www.ivoa.net/) to represent
astronomical queries posted to VO services (e.g.
[TAP](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/)). It is based on the Structured Query
Language (SQL), especially on [SQL-92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92)
(see also an online
[BNF version](https://ronsavage.github.io/SQL/sql-92.bnf.html) for an easy
navigation). The VO has a number of tabular data sets and many of them are
stored in relational databases, making SQL a convenient access means. Thus, a
subset of the SQL grammar has been extended to support queries that are
specific to astronomy.

## Status?

The last stable version is
**[REC-2.0](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html)**.

Next version will be 2.1. A
[Proposed Recommendation](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/20230418/) is
available. ADQL-2.1 is now (18th April 2023) starting its RFC period
(6+2 weeks minimum).

See also the section
[Releases](https://github.com/ivoa-std/ADQL/releases) of this GitHub Repository.

## What about this repository?

This GitHub repository contains the sources of the IVOA document describing
ADQL.

Only the LaTeX version is available here. No output version (e.g. PDF, HTML,
DOC) should be stored in this repository.

A PDF preview is automatically generated by a GitHub workflow. It is accessible
either by clicking of the above "Preview" badge or by looking at the
pre-release
["Auto updated PDF"](../../releases/tag/auto-pdf-preview).

An HTML version of the BNF is also directly available in this repository:
check out [adql-bnf.html](adql-bnf.html). It is generated from
[adql.bnf](adql.bnf) by the Makefile target named `bnf`. This latter uses the
Perl script [bnf2html.pl](bnf2html.pl), originally coming
<https://ronsavage.github.io/SQL/> and customized for the ADQL purpose.
Thanks to Mark Taylor for his research, time and efforts for providing this
generator. _Note that the HTML version of the BNF may be later automatically
generated by a GitHub workflow._

## Want to contribute?

1. [Raise a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ivoa-std/ADQL/issues/new) on this
   repository

2. Fork this repository _(eventually clone it on your machine if you want to)_

3. Create a branch in your forked repository ; this branch should be named after the issue(s) to fix (for instance: `issue-7-add-license`)

4. Commit suggested changes inside this branch

5. Create a Pull Request on the official repository _(note: a `git push` is needed first, if you are working on a clone)_

6. Wait for someone to review your Pull Request and accept it

_This process has been described and demonstrated during the IVOA Interoperability Meeting of Oct. 2019 in Groningen ; see [slides](https://wiki.ivoa.net/internal/IVOA/InterOpOct2019GitHub/IVOA_Github.pdf))_
