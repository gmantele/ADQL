# ADQL

## What is it?

ADQL: **A**stronomical **D**ata **Q**uery **L**anguage

ADQL is the language used by the [IVOA](http://www.ivoa.net/) to represent
astronomical queries posted to VO services (e.g.
[TAP](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/)). It is based on the Structured Query
Language (SQL), especially on [SQL-92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92).
The VO has a number of tabular data sets and many of them are stored in
relational databases, making SQL a convenient access means. Thus, a subset of
the SQL grammar has been extended to support queries that are specific to
astronomy.

## Status?

The last stable version is
**[REC-2.0](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html)**.

Next version will be 2.1. A
[Proposed Recommendation](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/20180112/) is
already available. _It is not yet finalized and so, should not be considered
yet as stable for operational implementation._

[Releases](https://github.com/ivoa-std/ADQL/releases) of this GitHub Repository.

## What about this repository?

This GitHub repository contains the sources of the IVOA document describing
ADQL.

Only the LaTeX version is available here. No output version (e.g. PDF, HTML,
DOC) should be stored in this repository.

A PDF preview is automatically generated by a GitHub workflow. It is accessible
either by clicking of the above "Preview" badge or by looking at the
pre-release
["Auto updated PDF"](../../releases/tag/auto-pdf-preview).
